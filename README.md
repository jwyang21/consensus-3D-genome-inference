# Inference of tissue type-specific consensus 3D genome using DNA methylation data

## 1. Overview
- Implementation of Fortin, Jean-Philippe, and Kasper D. Hansen. "Reconstructing A/B compartments as revealed by Hi-C using long-range correlations in epigenetic data." Genome biology 16.1 (2015): 1-23.
- Main idea:
  - Inferring information about 3D genome (A/B compartment distribution) using epigenetic data (450K methylation data)
